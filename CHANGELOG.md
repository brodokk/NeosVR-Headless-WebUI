# Changelog

## 2021-05-26
* Added this changelog
* Split `dashboard.html` into [base.html](neosvr_headless_webui/templates/base.html) and [dashboard.html](neosvr_headless_webui/templates/dashboard.html). `dashboard.html` was a full HTML document with minimal templating, so some features such as the navbar, sidebar, and general layout have been moved into a base template to allow their use site-wide.

## 2021-02-22
* Updated the README to point to the required API library.

## 2021-02-21
* Initial commit
* Switched from plain Bootstrap to the [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE) admin template.
